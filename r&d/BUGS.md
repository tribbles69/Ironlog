# Ironlog — found bugs

The running list of known, **non-critical** bugs, kept so they can be fixed
together in one batch rather than one at a time mid-feature.

**Critical bugs don't go here — fix them straight away.** Critical means: data
loss or corruption, the app won't open or a page white-screens, sync or import
damages a log, or a core flow (logging a set, finishing a session) is blocked.

## For agents

- **Found a bug while doing something else?** If it isn't critical, don't fix
  it in the middle of your feature: add it to **Open** below and carry on.
  Mention it in your summary and PR description ("logged B-012 to BUGS.md").
- **Doing a bug sweep?** Write each finding here. A big sweep can have its own
  note in `r&d/notes/` for the detail (like `bug-sweep-2026-11.md`), but every
  finding still gets a one-entry line here so this file is the one list.
- **Asked to "clear the bug list" / "fix the bugs"?** Work Open top to bottom
  (severity first, then oldest). Group fixes into as few versions as makes
  sense — one bump and one changelog entry for the batch is fine — but keep
  one commit per bug so each can be reverted alone. Move each fixed entry to
  **Fixed** with its version.
- Anything that needs Aaron's call goes under **Needs Aaron** with the
  question spelled out, not in Open.
- Check a bug is still real before fixing it; if it's gone, move it to Fixed
  with "not reproducible" and the version you checked against.

## Entry format

```

IDs run on and are never reused. Severity:

| Sev | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 2 | Wrong result a user would notice (bad number, wrong PR, missing data on screen) |
| 3 | Annoyance or edge case (layout glitch, odd shape of data, console error) |
| 4 | Tools, dev-only or cosmetic |

(Severity 1 is critical — not listed, fixed on the spot.)
